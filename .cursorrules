# AdaptiBot - Code Collaboration Rules

## Language & Communication
- **All code in English**: variable names, function names, class names, comments
- **All logs in English**: log messages, error messages, warnings
- **All UI notifications in English**: user-facing messages, tooltips, dialogs

## Logging Policy
- **Minimize logging**: only add logs where truly necessary
- **Essential logs only**:
  - Application lifecycle events (startup, shutdown)
  - Critical errors and exceptions
  - State transitions in core executor
  - Observer triggers (when conditions are met)
- **Avoid excessive logging**:
  - No debug logs for every method entry/exit
  - No info logs for trivial operations
  - No logs in hot paths (e.g., image matching loops)

## Documentation Policy
- **Minimal KDoc/JavaDoc**: only for complex classes that require explanation
- **Document when necessary**:
  - Public APIs and interfaces
  - Complex algorithms (e.g., Observer priority logic, image matching)
  - Non-obvious architectural decisions
- **Skip documentation for**:
  - Self-explanatory classes (DTOs, simple models)
  - Trivial getters/setters
  - Standard JavaFX controllers with obvious purpose
  - Utility functions with clear names

## Code Style
- Kotlin idiomatic style (use data classes, sealed classes, extension functions)
- Prefer immutability where possible
- Use meaningful names that explain intent
- Keep functions small and focused
